Escape is my submission for the d3t rising star game jam

it is the first game i have ever published.

Escape is a role-playing game in which you play a prisoner locked in a dungeon. one day you wake to notice the bars in your cell have been bent and there is just enough space to squeeze through. Now is your chance, Escape!

This game takes place in a medieval dungeon/castle where the player gets locked in a room after trying to escape. There is a laptop in the room where the player communicates with the "Game Master" of this escape room

after completing all the challenges and finding all the keys, the player unlocks a series of treasure chests, one with the final golden key in. using this key, the player unlocks the door and escapes the room.
